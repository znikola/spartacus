# Technical Changes in Spartacus 5.0

## Anonymous Consents

Anonymous consents have moved to `@spartacus/user/anonymous-users`.
This is the list of all the changes:

- AnonymousConsentTemplatesAdapter renamed to UserAnonymousConsentTemplatesAdapter
- AnonymousConsentTemplatesConnector renamed to UserAnonymousConsentTemplatesConnector
- OccAnonymousConsentTemplatesAdapter renamed to OccUserAnonymousConsentsAdapter

## TODO: Questions

- remove/deprecate/migrate the old styles?
- remove/deprecate/migrate the old translations?
- scss doesn't work from the lib

## TODO: to fix

- state persistence is in the core (therefore LL), and it uses a facade that talks to the ngrx store. This should be in the root, but the LL would be broken
- similarly, the interceptor is using the same facade. The interceptor should fire as soon as possible, ideally for the first OCC request

## TODO: improvements

- consent preferences button should be in the root for now
- the banner might not have to be CMS driven - see branch `feature/GH-13205-banner-ll`
- use the events for the transferring from anon to registered consents
- think about supporting the transfer and another session


TODO:#anon schematics:

- update the default set of modules for the new app for spartacus-features.module.ts - basically, remove:
  - AnonymousConsentsModule from core
  - AnonymousConsentManagementBannerModule and AnonymousConsentsDialogModule from storefront
- Write the migration for the above ?
- Anon consents as a feature

TODO:#anon - general todo:

- Deprecate the core / storefront stuff
- create anon consent events?
